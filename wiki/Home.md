## Question
<details>
<summary>Why 1.21.2 â€” 1.21.x ?</summary>

- Due to Spigot 1.21.1-R0.1-SNAPSHOT having an API named **"Menu Type"**, we decided to use that to create the **Inventory Builder API**. This makes the builder more flexible and able to create multiple types of inventories.

- Due to Spigot 1.21.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT having an API named **"Damage Resistant"**, ItemStack will be able to have damage-resistant flags. Ex: "DamageTypeTags.IS_FIRE" makes the item stack immune to fire. And an API named **"setItemModel(key)"** allows you to set an item's custom model based on a custom key or Minecraft key.
